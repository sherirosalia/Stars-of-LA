            <h2>20,000 restaurants analyzed</h2>
            <p>What does rating and review data reveal about the Los Angeles, California food scene? Let's take 
              a look at data on almost 20,000 eateries which was retrieved courtesy of the Yelp Developer API.
            </p>               
             <p>
              For those of you not familiar with it, Yelp (yelp.com) is a popular review site that uses a 1-5 rating scale; 5 being the best.

                Red represents ratings under 2.5, yellow below 4 and green is for top notch ratings which are either 4.5 or 5.

              defy the odds and either stay in business despite horrible reviews, or maintain top notch ratings along with
              high review counts.

            Perhaps the sheer volume of people with little other option than to grab a bite close to accomodations or flight times enables 
            these businesses to stay open despite poor ratings.

            <p>

              Most, but not every location is accounted for in this data set because of the way the Yelp api works. What we have here is a 
              random sampling of almost 20,000 establishment from over 150 zipcodes but there are likely more than 5,000 restaurants missing. 

            </p>
            <p>As is often 
              the case, diving into analysis produces more questions than actual conclusions.
              Ratings are subjective by nature. It is hard to be certain as to the reasons for them and in          
              the age of paid social influencers, their veracity suspect.
