              <p>Ratings, reviews and geographical data were accumulated courtesy of the Yelp developer api.</p>
              <p>The Python scripts for the api pull and map visualized below live on this Github repository:

              <p>Data cleanup and visualization utilizing Python Pandas mostly in Jupyter notebooks are here: <a href="https://github.com/sherirosalia/stars-of-LA">stars_of_la GitHub repository</a></p>
      
              <p>The data visualized below is explored in depth in the notebooks available in the github, and the 
                csv files are available for download. Please feel free to clone the repository and I would love to

              <p>
                Data collection was restricted to Los Angeles zipcodes that start with "900"
                since that seemed like a reasonable way to keep close to city center and due to the way
                the api works, the resultant collection reflects a random sampling of almost 20,000 establishments
                from over 150 zipcodes.

              of roughly 3.8 - 4.1 if an establishment could stay around long enough, there are a few that managed to
              defy the odds and either stay in business despite horrible reviews, or maintain top notch ratings along with
              high review counts.

            relatively high number of reviews.

              a search for "Persian" food revealed:

            <h2>The limitations, the plan</h2>
            <p>As is often 
              the case, diving into analysis produces more questions and potentially interesting pursuits than actual conclusions.
              It is hard to draw conclusions as to the reasons for ratings. It is somewhat subjective by nature, and in               
              the age of paid social influencers, sometimes even suspect. That being said, there are additonal data 
              points that can be brought in from the developer api such as price category and the open data program
              supported by the city of Los Angeles allows substantial demographic content to be incorporated.  The next 
              step will be to incorporate a few more data points and run the data through some machine learning algorithms 
              to see what more can be revealed.
